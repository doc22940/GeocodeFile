geocodefile
~~~~~~~~~~~

This script lets you run a file full of addresses or other location strings through Yahoo's Geoplanet geocoding API. The input format is simply a text file made up of a series of lines, each of which is treated as a location string and fed through the API. The latitude and longitude are printed for each location, optionally prefixed by the original location string followed by a tab.

To test it, run it like this:

./geocodefile.php -i testdata.txt -o output.txt -s

After a few seconds it should complete, and the output should contain estimated latitude,longitude coordinates for each location.

You will need to obtain your own Yahoo App ID from  http://developer.yahoo.com/geo/ and insert it into the script before you can run it.
